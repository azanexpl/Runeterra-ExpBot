# Runeterra-ExpBot
Exp bot for Legends of Runeterra.

Bot vs AI just surrenders in vs AI match as long as you're getting exp from those consecutive losses.
Bot vs Players needs to be ran on both accounts that want to be making profit. One needs to open RuneterraPodBotSurrender, and the other one needs to launch RuneterraPodBotGainExp.
The one who chose RuneterraPodBotSurrender needs to make a tiny screenshot of the 2nd account nickname in friends list and save it in the (...)/RuneterraPodBot directory.
Also in RuneterraPodBotSurrender line 23 needs to be changed for whatever you called your image like.
